# Implementation Plan: Todo Application CLI

**Branch**: `001-todo-cli-app` | **Date**: 2026-01-06 | **Spec**: specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a menu-driven CLI Todo application in Python that stores tasks in memory only. The application will provide a clear and guided user experience through a menu system with 7 options: Add Task, View Tasks, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark Task as Complete, Mark Task as Incomplete, and Exit. The application must follow all constitution principles including deterministic behavior, error resilience, and Python-only technology stack. The solution will be built with clean separation of concerns using models for data entities, services for business logic, and CLI module for user interface.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as specified in constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard Python libraries only (os, sys, datetime, json, etc.) - no external dependencies beyond Python standard library
**Storage**: In-memory only using Python list/dictionary (as specified in constitution - no file/database persistence)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests (standard Python testing framework)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project CLI application (determined from constitution requirements)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response time for all operations, minimal memory usage for task storage
**Constraints**: Must comply with all constitution principles including no manual coding, menu-driven interface, error resilience
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application with in-memory storage, designed for personal task management

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Required Compliance Checks:
- [x] Spec-Driven Development: All code must be generated by Claude Code based on specifications; No manual coding by the developer
- [x] Python-Only Technology: Application must be built exclusively in Python 3.13+; No other languages or frameworks allowed
- [x] In-Memory Architecture: All data must be stored in memory only; No databases, files, or persistence mechanisms
- [x] Menu-Driven CLI Interface: Application must present a clear and guided user experience through a menu system
- [x] Deterministic Behavior: Application must have predictable and consistent behavior; Same inputs must always produce same outputs
- [x] Error Handling Resilience: No crashes under any circumstances; All errors must be user-friendly
- [x] Technology Stack Compliance: Uses Python 3.13+, UV package manager, Claude Code, and Spec-Kit Plus only
- [x] Out of Scope Validation: Does NOT include file storage, authentication, tags/priorities/due dates, search/filtering, AI/NLP features, or GUI/web UI

**Structure Decision**: Single project CLI application selected as per constitution requirements. The structure follows clean architecture principles with separation of concerns: models for data entities, services for business logic, CLI for user interface, and lib for utilities. Tests are organized by type (unit, integration, contract) to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

No constitution violations identified. All requirements from the constitution have been addressed in the technical approach and architecture decisions. Additional improvements made during planning include:

- Enhanced contract specifications with detailed validation and error handling requirements
- Comprehensive testing strategy covering unit, integration, and contract tests
- Detailed datetime handling specifications with ISO 8601 format requirements
- Specific error recovery protocols that ensure application resilience
- Detailed validation rules for all user inputs
