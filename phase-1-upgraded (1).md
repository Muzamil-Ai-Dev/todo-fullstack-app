# Phase 1 – Advanced In-Memory CLI Todo Application (Spec-Driven)

> **Purpose of this document**  
> This file is the **single source of truth for Phase 1**.  
> It is intentionally detailed so it can be given directly to **Claude Code** to generate:
> 1. `Constitution.md`
> 2. Feature specification files (`specs/*.md`)
>  
> ❗ **No code must be written manually.**

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project:** Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo  
**Phase:** Phase I  
**Application Type:** In-Memory Python CLI Todo Application  
**Development Method:** Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

This phase focuses on building a **clean, deterministic, menu-driven command-line Todo application** that runs entirely in memory and demonstrates professional software architecture principles.

---

## 2. Phase Objective

Build a **menu-driven CLI Todo app** that:

- Stores all tasks in memory
- Provides a clear and guided user experience
- Supports full task lifecycle management
- Is generated entirely via Claude Code using specifications

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Constraints (Critical)

- ❌ No manual coding by the developer
- ✅ All code must be generated by Claude Code
- ✅ Specs must be written and refined before implementation
- ✅ Python only
- ❌ No databases, files, or persistence
- ❌ No AI, NLP, or web features

---

## 4. Technology Stack

- Python 3.13+
- UV (Python package manager)
- Claude Code
- Spec-Kit Plus

---

## 5. Application Startup & Main Menu

When the application starts, it MUST display the following menu **every time** until the user exits:

```
==== Todo Application ====
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Delete Task
5. Mark Task as Complete
6. Mark Task as Incomplete
7. Exit

Choose an option (1-7):
```

### Menu Rules
- Input must be validated
- Invalid choices show a friendly error and re-display menu
- Menu loops until user selects `7`

---

## 6. Core Domain Model (In-Memory)

Each task MUST contain the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-------------|
| id | int | Auto-incremented unique ID |
| title | str | Required (1–200 chars) |
| description | str \| None | Optional |
| completed | bool | Completion status |
| created_at | datetime | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | datetime | Last modification timestamp |

Tasks are stored in-memory using a list or dictionary.

---

## 7. Detailed Feature Behavior (Step-by-Step)

---

### 7.1 Option 1 — Add Task

**User Flow:**
1. User selects `1`
2. App prints:
   ```
   --- Add New Task ---
   ```
3. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter task title:
   ```
4. Validation:
   - Title is required
   - Cannot be empty
   - Max length: 200 characters
5. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter task description (optional):
   ```
6. App:
   - Generates task ID
   - Sets `completed = False`
   - Sets timestamps
7. Confirmation message:
   ```
   Task added successfully with ID #3
   ```

---

### 7.2 Option 2 — View Tasks

**User Flow:**
1. User selects `2`
2. If no tasks exist:
   ```
   No tasks found.
   ```
3. If tasks exist, display:

```
----------------------------------
ID: 1
Title: Buy groceries
Description: Milk and eggs
Status: [ ] Pending
Created: 2026-01-05 14:22
----------------------------------
```

**Display Rules:**
- `[✓]` for completed
- `[ ]` for pending
- Sorted by ID (ascending)

---

### 7.3 Option 3 — Update Task

**User Flow:**
1. User selects `3`
2. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter task ID to update:
   ```
3. Validation:
   - Must exist
4. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter new title (leave blank to keep current):
   ```
5. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter new description (leave blank to keep current):
   ```
6. App updates:
   - Fields provided
   - `updated_at`
7. Confirmation:
   ```
   Task #2 updated successfully.
   ```

---

### 7.4 Option 4 — Delete Task

**User Flow:**
1. User selects `4`
2. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter task ID to delete:
   ```
3. Validation:
   - Must exist
4. Confirmation:
   ```
   Are you sure you want to delete task #2? (y/n):
   ```
5. On `y`:
   ```
   Task #2 deleted successfully.
   ```
6. On `n`:
   ```
   Delete operation cancelled.
   ```

---

### 7.5 Option 5 — Mark Task as Complete

**User Flow:**
1. User selects `5`
2. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter task ID to mark as complete:
   ```
3. Rules:
   - Task must exist
   - If already completed, show:
     ```
     Task is already completed.
     ```
4. Success:
   ```
   Task #1 marked as completed.
   ```

---

### 7.6 Option 6 — Mark Task as Incomplete

**User Flow:**
1. User selects `6`
2. Prompt:
   ```
   Enter task ID to mark as incomplete:
   ```
3. Rules:
   - Task must exist
   - If already pending, show:
     ```
     Task is already pending.
     ```
4. Success:
   ```
   Task #1 marked as pending.
   ```

---

### 7.7 Option 7 — Exit Application

**User Flow:**
1. User selects `7`
2. App prints:
   ```
   Thank you for using Todo Application. Goodbye!
   ```
3. Program exits cleanly

---

## 8. Error Handling Rules

- No crashes
- All errors must be user-friendly
- Application must always recover to main menu

---

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- Deterministic behavior
- Clean separation of concerns
- Readable CLI output
- Consistent prompts
- Predictable state changes

---

## 10. Out of Scope (Phase 1 Only)

- File or database storage
- Authentication
- Tags, priorities, due dates
- Search or filtering
- AI or NLP features
- GUI or web UI

---

## 11. Required Repository Structure

```
todo-phase1/
├── Constitution.md
├── specs/
│   ├── add-task.md
│   ├── view-tasks.md
│   ├── update-task.md
│   ├── delete-task.md

## 12. How This File Should Be Used With Claude Code

### Step 1
Give this file to Claude and say:
> Create `Constitution.md` for Phase 1 based on this document. Do not write code.

### Step 2
After reviewing Constitution, say:
> Using Constitution.md and phase-1.md, generate feature specifications.

### Step 3
Then:
> Generate plan → tasks → implementation.
