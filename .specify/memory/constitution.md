# Todo Application Phase 1 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code must be generated by Claude Code based on specifications; No manual coding by the developer; Specs must be written and refined before implementation; Every feature must have a clear specification before implementation begins.

### II. Python-Only Technology Constraint
Application must be built exclusively in Python 3.13+; No other languages or frameworks allowed; All dependencies must be Python-based; Follow Python best practices and conventions.

### III. In-Memory Architecture
All tasks must be stored in memory only; No databases, files, or persistence mechanisms; Data exists only during application runtime; Clean slate on each application restart.

### IV. Menu-Driven CLI Interface
Application must present a clear and guided user experience through a menu system; Main menu must be displayed every time until user exits; All user interactions must flow through the defined menu options; Consistent prompts and user-friendly messages required; Application must display the exact menu format as specified with options 1-7 and loop until user selects option 7 (Exit).

### V. Deterministic Behavior (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Application must have predictable and consistent behavior; No random or non-deterministic elements; Same inputs must always produce same outputs; State changes must be predictable and consistent.

### VI. Error Handling Resilience
No crashes under any circumstances; All errors must be user-friendly; Application must always recover to main menu; Graceful degradation required for all error conditions.

## Domain Rules

### Task Model Constraints
Each task must contain: id (auto-incremented unique int), title (required str 1-200 chars), description (optional str), completed (bool status), created_at (datetime), updated_at (datetime); Tasks stored in-memory using list or dictionary; All fields must be properly validated and maintained; Title must be 1-200 characters (no empty titles allowed); ID must auto-increment from 1 for each new task; Timestamps must be in ISO format; Completed status must be boolean (True/False).

### Menu Behavior Requirements
Main menu must display options 1-7 exactly as specified; Input must be validated for menu choices; Invalid choices show friendly error and re-display menu; Menu loops until user selects option 7 (Exit); Menu must be presented in the exact format specified; Application must show the menu immediately upon startup.

### Application Startup Requirements
Application must display the exact main menu format immediately upon startup; Initial task list must be empty; First task ID must start at 1 and increment sequentially; Application must maintain consistent state throughout execution; All timestamps must use the same datetime format throughout the session.

### Feature Behavior Compliance
All features must follow the exact step-by-step user flows defined in the specification; No deviations from specified prompts, messages, or behaviors; Input validation must match specified requirements; Confirmation messages must match exact text specified; All user inputs must be validated according to the detailed specifications in the phase document.

### Display Formatting Requirements
Task display must follow the exact format specified with proper separators and field layout; Completed tasks must show as `[✓]` and pending as `[ ]`; Tasks must be sorted by ID in ascending order when displayed; Date/time must be displayed in consistent format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM); All user-facing messages must match the exact text specified in the requirements.

### Input Validation Requirements
All user inputs must be strictly validated: task titles must be 1-200 characters with no empty values; task IDs must exist in the current task list when updating/deleting; numeric inputs must be within expected ranges; confirmation prompts must accept only 'y'/'n' or 'Y'/'N' inputs; menu selections must be integers 1-7 only.

## Error Handling Expectations

### Recovery Protocol
Application must never crash; All errors must result in user-friendly messages; Application must always return to main menu after error; No data loss during error conditions; Clean state recovery required.

### Validation Requirements
All user inputs must be validated according to specification; Invalid data must be rejected with appropriate error messages; Boundary conditions must be properly handled; Format validation must be strict but user-friendly.

## Technology Stack Requirements

### Core Technologies
Python 3.13+ as the only programming language; UV as the Python package manager; Claude Code for all code generation; Spec-Kit Plus for development workflow; No additional technologies without explicit approval.

### Architecture Constraints
No databases, files, or persistence mechanisms; No AI, NLP, or web features; No external services or APIs; In-memory only operation; Menu-driven command-line interface only.

## Out of Scope for Phase 1

### Explicitly Excluded Features
File or database storage; Authentication systems; Tags, priorities, due dates; Search or filtering capabilities; AI or NLP features; GUI or web UI; Advanced data management features; Network connectivity or remote data access.

### Technology Restrictions
No external databases; No file system persistence; No web frameworks; No GUI libraries; No network protocols; No third-party services integration.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other development practices; All implementation must comply with these principles; Amendments require explicit documentation and approval; All code generation must verify compliance with constitution; Version control required for all changes; Quality gates must validate constitution compliance.
