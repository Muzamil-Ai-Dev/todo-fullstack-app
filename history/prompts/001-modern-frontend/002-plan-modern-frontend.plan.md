# Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

# Response Text
Successfully created the implementation plan for the modern frontend design. The plan includes:

1. Technical Context: Defining the technology stack (React, TypeScript, Material UI, Framer Motion)
2. Constitution Check: Verifying compliance with project principles
3. Project Structure: Outlining both documentation and source code organization
4. Phase 0 Research: Detailing decisions on Material UI, responsive design, animations, dark mode, and accessibility
5. Phase 1 Design: Covering data models, API contracts, and quickstart guide

Additional supporting files were created:
- research.md: Detailed research findings on technology choices
- data-model.md: Data models for the frontend application
- quickstart.md: Setup and development guide
- contracts/api-contracts.md: API contract documentation

The plan follows the project constitution and prepares for the next phase of development.

# Outcome
A complete implementation plan has been created that satisfies all requirements from the feature specification and aligns with the project constitution. The plan is ready for the next phase of development.

# Evaluation
The implementation plan comprehensively addresses all aspects of the modern frontend feature, with clear technical decisions, architecture, and implementation approach documented. The plan enables moving forward with confidence to the task generation phase.
